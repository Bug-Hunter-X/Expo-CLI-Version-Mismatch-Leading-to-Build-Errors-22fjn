This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage your React Native project.  It happens when there's a mismatch between the versions of Expo CLI you have installed globally and locally within your project. This can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected build errors, dependency conflicts, and inability to run the project correctly. The error message may not always be explicit about the version mismatch but might instead report other issues stemming from the conflict.
